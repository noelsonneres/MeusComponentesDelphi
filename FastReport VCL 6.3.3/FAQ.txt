Question:  I would like to know if there is any possibility of rotating TfrxRichView.

 
Answer

No , you cannot rotate it .  
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question:  Is it possible from FastReport to set a different printer ?

 
Answer

Maybe you want to use a diffrent printer in the report definition (the 
*.fr3-file) so that this printer becomes the default printer for this 
specific report? To do this in the report designer choose "Options..." in 
the "Report"-menu. Select the "General" tab in the dialog and choose desired 
printer in the printer list.
Of course you can also select/alter printer from the preview window or by code from your delphi application.

Question:  Is Fast Report 4 Thread Safe? Are there any special properties I need to set when using FR from threads?

 
Answer

Yes, it's Thread Safe.

Create a report object inside thread and set this property:
frxReport.EngineOptions.EnableThreadSafe := True;
frxReport.EngineOptions.DestroyForms := False;

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question:  How can I limit rowcount per page ?

 
Answer

   Use the line# variable in the OnBeforePrint event of the band write code to
   check the line# variable and use engine.newpage to force the newpage.

 
------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

Question:  How to disconnect the use of global list of Datasets when using TfrxReport in a stream ?

 
Answer

At default FastReport uses grobal Datasets list which are initialized in the module frxClass. After creating copies of TfrxDBDataset, it adds it them this list. In view of this, it�s not possible to use Datasets with the same name (Even in different streams). For using local Datasets , you need to use the following code :

  frxReport.EngineOptions.UseGlobalDataSetList := False;
  frxReport.EnabledDataSets.Clear();
  frxReport.EnabledDataSets.Add(frxDataSet);
  frxReport.LoadFromFile(ReportName);

------------------------------------------------------------------------  


Question:  When creating a report with cross-table , an error comes up �Could not convert variant of type (String) into type (Double)�.

 
Answer

If in the cross-table cells you used string values, then you need to disconnect functions arguments in the cross-table editor .  
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question:  In the report its required to write a text with fixed width into TfrxMemoView ,reducing font size from 10 and below , until the smallest . How can this be done ?

 
Answer

Use the function TfrxMemoView.CalcWidth in the TfrxMemoView.OnAfterData: 
procedure Memo1OnAfterData(Sender: TfrxComponent);
begin
  Memo1.Font.Size:=10;       
   if Memo1.CalcWidth>Memo1.Width-Memo1.GapX*2 then
     Memo1.Font.Size:=Trunc(Memo1.Font.Size*((Memo1.Width-Memo1.GapX*2)/Memo1.CalcWidth));  
end;

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Question:  Can you dynamically change designer localization as well as preview windows ?

 
Answer

Make language file a utility of mkall.bat ( in languages catalogue) and connect the language dynamically. 
uses frxRes;
frxResources.LoadFromFile('english.xml');

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question:  How can you transfer an array of variables from Delphi into FR ?

 
Answer


var a: variant;
begin
 a := VarArrayOf([1,2,3]);
 frxReport1.Script.Variables['a'] := a;
end;

------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
Question:  During compilation of the project, a message shows � Class TfrxButtonControl not found'.

 
Answer

Add the component TfrxDialogControls (TfrxRichObject, TfrxCrossObject, TfrxOLEObject, TfrxBarCodeObject, TfrxCheckBoxObject, TfrxGradientObject, frxChartObject, TfrxADOComponents, etc.) from FR component panel into the project or add in the uses section the following modules: frxDCtrl, frxRich, frxCross, frxOLE, frxBarcode, frxChBox, frxGradient, frxChart, frxADOComponents.  
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question:  How can you code dataset navigation connected to the report but not connected to any band in report script ?

 
Answer


var DS: TfrxDataSet;
begin
    DS:=Report.GetDataset('Items');
    DS.First;
    while not DS.Eof do      
      begin          
        ShowMessage(DS.Value('Part Name'));
        DS.NEXT;
      end;        
end.

Question:  I try to set a Memo frame in script. I write Memo1.Frame.Typ := [ftLeft, ftRight, ftTop, ftBottom]. But I receive an error. Why ?

Question:  How can I use report converter - QuickReport to FastReport?

 
Answer

Just add the module ConverterQR2FR into uses section and using:
conv := TConverterQr2Fr.Create;

conv.Target := FReport;
conv.Convert;
FReport.SaveToFile('converted_fromQR.fr3');
